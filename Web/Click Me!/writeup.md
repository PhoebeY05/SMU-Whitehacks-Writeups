# Steps
1. Inspect the website using Chrome Developer Tools => 2 ways to do so:
   
     a) Click on the three vertical dots => Go to More Tools -> Developer Tools
   
     b) Use keyboard shortcut key Command + Option + C (MAcOS) or Control + Shift + C (Windows)
2. Notice that the position of the button is always changing => Remove all styles in the HTML
     - In the Elements tab, remove all `class = ?` by right-clicking and choosing 'Edit as HTML'
3. Tap on the button to get the flag
