# Description
By any chance, do you have a time machine so that I can go back to the last archived version of the Whitehats website from 2023? I accidentally let the dinosaurs loose and they destroyed the site. I need to find a way back to that version.

Please format it using the WH2024{DDMMYYYY} format.

# Steps
1. To find previous versions of a website, go to https://archive.org/
2. Input the SMU Whitehat's website (https://whitehats.sis.smu.edu.sg/) into Internet Archive then take note of the last date it was saved (September 30, 2023) => The flag is WH2024{30092023}
